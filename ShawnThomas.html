	<h1>Shawn Thomas</h1>
	<p>Hello!  My name is Shawn Thomas.  I am currently attending Arkansas State University in Mountain Home, in pursuit of an Associate's of Mobile App Development/Programming.  I have three semesters of classes remaining 
	and will graduate at the end of the fall 2020 semester.  Afterwards, I will pursue a career in UX Design.  The reason for that specific area is that I enjoy using the techniques I've developed to create something that looks
	and feels good for anyone who uses the final product.</p>
